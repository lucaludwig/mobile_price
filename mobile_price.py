# <h1>1.2 Clustering</h1>
# <p>As part of this sub-question you will perform clustering on your chosen dataset from the above links. Choose one of the clustering algorithms that were discussed during the lecture for the application on your chosen dataset. Then choose few columns from your dataset that you think suitable for performing your chosen clustering. Describe and reflect on the clustering results and you are free to use the graphs/images and any other sort of visualizations also.
# </p>

# In[75]:


# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nick-edu/dmmldl/master/MobilePrice.csv")

# Select the three most relevant features from the dataset
df_clustering = df[["battery_power", "ram", "n_cores"]]

# Scaling variables
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
df_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df_clustering)

# Define a set of clusters
range_n_clusters = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10]


# <h2>Silhouette Score</h2>
# <p>In order to find the most accurate number of clusters</p>

# In[76]:


score_list = []
for n_clusters in range_n_clusters:
    clusterer = KMeans(n_clusters = n_clusters)
    preds = clusterer.fit_predict(df_scaled)
    centers = clusterer.cluster_centers_

    score = silhouette_score(df_scaled, preds)
    score_list.append(score)
    print("For n_clusters = {}, silhouette score is {})".format(n_clusters, score))
    
sns.lineplot(range_n_clusters, score_list)


# <p>The above graph suggests using from 6 to 8 clusters as they are the ones maximizing the silhouette score. However, the value of the silhouette score highlights the fact that the clusters are not very clearly separated, and some overlapping may occur in some instances.</p>
# <p>We decide to carry on building a model using 6 clusters</p>

# In[81]:


# define the kmeans model
kmeans_clustering_model = KMeans(n_clusters=6)


# In[140]:


# get the six clusters labels and store it in the dataframe

ax.set_ylabel('ram')

# <p>From the analysis of the chart we can see there is still some overlapping among the clusters. However, we can see the distinction among the clusters, centering mainly at the extremeties of each features distributions</p>
